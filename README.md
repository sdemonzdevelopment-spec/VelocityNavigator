# üß≠ VelocityNavigator
## A public plugin from **DemonZ Development** üí´!
A lightweight and configurable lobby and server navigation plugin for Velocity-powered Minecraft networks. VelocityNavigator provides simple, global commands to send players to your hub or lobby servers, with multiple modes for balancing and behavior.

## ‚ú® Features
* **Global Commands**: A robust `/lobby` command to navigate from any backend server.
* **Highly Configurable**: Control everything from command aliases to connection logic through the simple `navigator.toml` file.
* **Permission Support**: An optional permission node to control who can use the commands.
* **Smart Reconnect**: Intelligently handles cases where players are already in a lobby, allowing them to be sent to spawn instead of just seeing an error.
* **Automatic Updates**: Seamlessly migrates old configuration files to the newest format on plugin updates, preserving your settings.
* **Lightweight & Efficient**: Designed to do one job perfectly without adding bulk to your proxy.

## üöÄ Installation
1. Download the latest `.jar` file from the project's Releases page.
2. Place the `VelocityNavigator-x.x.x.jar` file into the `plugins` folder of your Velocity proxy.
3. Start your proxy once to generate the default configuration file.
4. Stop the proxy. Navigate to `plugins/velocitynavigator/` and edit the `navigator.toml` to your liking.
5. Start your proxy again. You're all set!
